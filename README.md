# RDO RPM Macros

This package contains compatibility macros with Fedora for RDO packages.
These are needed to reduce the gap between Fedora and RHEL/CentOS spec files.
Just add it to your packages buildroot and it will be used transparently.


# Notes

It is based upon similar package from EPEL called epel-rpm-macros.
